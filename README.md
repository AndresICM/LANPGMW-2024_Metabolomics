## Introduction

In the previous sections, we explored the biosynthetic potential of various strains by analyzing the BGCs within their genomes. We utilized BiG-SCAPE to create BGC networks, which compare all the BGCs detected by antiSMASH to determine their relatedness. 
Similarly, using metabolomics we can investigate the metabolites produced by selected strains in the laboratory. While crude extracts can be made to analyze the metabolites of specific strains, it is also possible to study the metabolites present in complex samples, such as soil, marine environments, host organisms, or stool samples.
There are two approaches to annotating metabolomics data. The first comprises using the information obtained by LC-MS, comparing the exact mass and UV spectra of each detected metabolite through natural product databases.
The introduction of the global natural products social molecular networking [GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp) platform for molecular networking (M. Wang et al., 2016), significantly influenced dereplication techniques. Molecular networking groups metabolites into molecular families (MFs), thereby improving the annotation process of unknown metabolites.

## Creating a GNPS account

Before starting this tutorial, it will be useful to have a GNPS account. For that go to the 
[GNPS](https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/static/gnps-splash.jsp) webpage 
and select Create a new account.

Then fill in the following information: 
  -Username	
  -Name	
  -Organization	
  -Email	
  -Password
Wait for a confirmation email, and you now have a GNPS account.
